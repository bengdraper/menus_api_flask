# needs to be refactored a little:
# htis housing endpoints for users, stores, some chart of accounts, 
# menus, vendores; named as menus under modules, rethink later
# started bind volume container as dev so no start app 
# because something wrong at wsgi create app import ...
# started here and mount app/menus works fine.  Commit changes at local source, run app here for test.

# create v env inside docker container:
$ python -m venv venv

# activate v env (@ /app):
$ source venv/bin/activate

# start server
$ flask run

# venv activated per terminal session reactivate each session...

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ deactivate


# thinking through api model
#@ models : model each table as class
#build module for each end point relation? 

# // object for record as instance of table class
# // end point collections relate to table / class?
